# A Simple Sudoku Solver in Julia

* Uses Simulated Annealing from the optim.jl package.
* Uses a very naive cost function.
* See demo.jl for usage example. This demo may need to be run a few times before you get lucky and hit the exact solution.

_Disclaimer_: I've solved exactly one Sudoku in my life before. I'm not sure I understand the rules. What I understand, I've taken from the [Wikipedia article on Sudoku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku). Also, I'm definitely not trying to solve Sudoku problems in a smart way. I just wanted to show how easy it is to solve seemingly "complex" problems using something as stupid as simulated annealing.
