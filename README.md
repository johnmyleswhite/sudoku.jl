# A Simple Sudoku Solver in Julia

* Uses Simulated Annealing from the optim.jl package.
* Uses a very naive cost function.
* See demo.jl for usage example. This demo may need to be run a few times before you get lucky and hit the exact solution.

_Disclaimer_: I've solved exactly one Sudoku in my life before. I'm not sure I understand the rules. And I'm definitely not trying to do things in a smart way. I just wanted to show how easy it is to solve seemingly "complex" problems using something as stupid as simulated annealing.
