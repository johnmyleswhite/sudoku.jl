# simulated_annealing
# Arguments:
# * cost: Function from states to the real numbers. Often called an energy function, but this algorithm works for both positive and negative costs.
# * s0: The initial state of the system.
# * neighbor: Function from states to states. Produces what the Metropolis algorithm would call a proposal.
# * temperature: Function specifying the temperature at time i.
# * iterations: How many iterations of the algorithm should be run? This is the only termination condition.
# * keep_best: Do we return the best state visited or the last state visisted? (Should default to true.)
# * show_trace: Do we show a trace of the system's evolution?
